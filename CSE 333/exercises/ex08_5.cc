// ======================================
// ====== Comprehension Questions =======
// ======================================
//
// Each of the below questions can be answered in ~20 words (and
// definitely no more than 40).  For reference, the sample solution's
// answers are <20 words.  WE WILL STOP READING IF YOUR ANSWER IS
// >40 WORDS, so keep them concise please :)
//
// 1. What is the difference between "const int *" and "int *const"?
//    The difference between "const int *" and "int *const" is that
//    the former is a pointer to a constant integer, while the latter
//    is a constant pointer to an integer.
//
// 2. List one difference between a pointer and a reference.
//    One difference between a pointer and a reference is that a
//    a pointer can be reassigned to point to a different memory while
//    a reference cannot.
//
